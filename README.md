# Welcome to My Portfolio Website!

- I’m Mario Esquivel, a Computer Science student at Georgia Tech and an aspiring software engineer. This site is a showcase of my journey—highlighting the projects I’ve built, the skills I’ve developed, and the services I offer.

- Designed with a clean, modern interface using React and styled with custom CSS, the site reflects my focus on usability and aesthetics. Whether it’s full-stack applications, AI/ML experiments, or tech support insights, each section tells a story of learning, problem-solving, and growth.

- I built this portfolio not just to present my work, but to demonstrate how I think, build, and iterate as a developer.
