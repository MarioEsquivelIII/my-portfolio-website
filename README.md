# Welcome to My Portfolio 🚀

Hi, I'm **Mario Esquivel** — a Computer Science student at **Georgia Tech** and an aspiring **software engineer** with a passion for building, learning, and solving real-world problems through code.

This portfolio is more than just a collection of projects — it’s a reflection of my journey as a developer. From full-stack applications and AI/ML experiments to hands-on tech support insights, each section captures how I approach challenges and continuously grow in the tech space.

✨ **Highlights:**
- Built with **React** and styled using custom **CSS** for a clean, modern look
- Showcases my experience in **frontend & backend development**, **machine learning**, and **cloud-based solutions**
- Offers insight into how I **think**, **build**, and **iterate**
