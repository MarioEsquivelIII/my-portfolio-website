                    <h1>Aspiring Software Engineer/Developer!</h1>
                    <p> ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! 
                        Hi, Iâ€™m Mario A. Esquivel III, a Computer Science student at Georgia Tech with a passion for creating, building, and solving real-world problems through technology. While Iâ€™m currently gaining experience across a wide range of software engineering roles, my ultimate dream is to become a game developer â€” crafting immersive worlds and interactive experiences. Until then, Iâ€™m excited to grow as a software engineer, applying my creativity and problem-solving skills wherever I can.
                        I currently work part-time at Georgia Tech providing technical support for the College of Sciences, where I troubleshoot systems, deploy tools, and ensure everything runs smoothly behind the scenes. Iâ€™ve also worked in high-pressure team environments, like Chick-fil-A, where I learned the value of reliability and collaboration.
                        Whether itâ€™s building web apps to help others or diving into AI-powered projects, I love the feeling of turning ideas into something real. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow and maybe one day, make that leap into game development.ðŸ“§ mesquivel30@gatech.edu | ðŸ”— <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/mario-esquivel-9b6900239/' target='_blank'><img src={linkedin_icon} width={30}/></a></p>
